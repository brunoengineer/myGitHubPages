[Live Demo](https://brunoengineer.github.io/myGitHubPages/)

A simple web app to show my GitHub Pages projects.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrunoWebDesigner/myGitHubPages.git

2. Open script.js and set your GitHub username:
const username = "YourGitHubUsername";

3. Open index.html in a browser or use a local server:
python -m http.server 8000

## Features
Shows my GitHub Pages repos.
Nice grid layout.
Updates every 5 minutes.

## Files
index.html: Main page
styles.css: Styles
script.js: Gets data from GitHub

## Problems?
No repos? Check your username and if Pages is enabled.
Errors? Look at the browser console (F12).

This version is shorter, puts the demo link upfront, and keeps things straightforward. Replace `YourGitHubUsername` and the demo URL with your actual details when you deploy it. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
